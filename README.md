MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.   Several of the technologies that social networking platforms use full-stack applications MongoDb is an essential part of the stack. 
Because the foundation of these applications is data, it’s important to understand how to build and structure the API first.The application is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. The application takes a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

SO, the website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.
When in the social network API, the command is entered to invoke the application, server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.
In INSOMNIA, when API GET routes for users and thoughts are sent, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
Similarly, when tested for API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia data is played in a formatted JSON.
We can also successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in database, along with successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list.
